# IoT-Based-Fall-Detection-System
IoT in Healthcare : Falls are a leading cause for injury and death (in severe cases) among elderly people and can lead to a decline in overall health and independence. 
This project was done with an objective of improving safety measures, detect falls, and alert caregivers or emergency services for timely assistance using IoT Sensors, Modules, Cloud Services and Algorithms.
In this project, we have used a combination of IoT sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud services to detect falls and send notifications to a designated contact. 

We've used an accelerometer sensor to detect the fall, an Arduino for data processing, and an IoT platform like ThingSpeak or Blynk to send notifications.
Scope for this project includes, encompassing a wide range of possibilities and applications, providing a valuable solution for enhancing the safety and well-being of individuals who are at risk of falling.
The scope for IoT-based fall detection systems is continually expanding, driven by technological advancements, an aging population, and the increasing demand for remote monitoring and healthcare solutions. The potential to improve safety, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the quality of life for individuals at risk of falling makes this technology a significant area of development and application.
